# Derp Scan

Derp Scan is (going to be) a painfully simple app that scans files directly to PDF files. This is meant to help me
automate the process of getting documents into Evernote, so I can get rid of them quicker.

It's still a very early WIP &ndash; I plan on doing extensive work on this in the coming weeks.
